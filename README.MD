# Issue Processor

## Idea

Just our of curiosity I decided to track my daily activity like which movies I watch, books I read, etc. For this purpose I chose Jira since it's very common and has powerful api.

## How it works

I set up my personal Jira (up to 10 people it's free). Whenever I want to watch a movie, play game or something else I create an ticket with link in description. Current project catches changes and process ticket by filling important data like title, time spend (in case of movies), description, etc.

## What is next?

- add more link parsers, like:
    - Youtube
    - https://www.goodreads.com/
    - Wikipedia    
- add monthly reports
